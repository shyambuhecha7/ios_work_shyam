/*
 Raw Values VS Associated Values :
 -raw values are predefined constant values provided to each enum value.
 
 enum Vehicle: String {

   case car = "Four Wheeler"
   case bike = "Two Wheeler"
 }
 -associated values are more like variables associated with the enum values.
 enum Marks {
   
   case grade(String)
   case gpa(Double)
 }
 
 we assign the associated value to the enum value while creating a variable.
 
 
 ///Note :
 
 An enum cannot have both raw values and associated values at the same time.
 The raw values of an enum must be of the same data type. But associated values can be of any type.
 */

//Implicitly Assigned Raw Values
//when integers are used for raw values, the implicit value for each case is one more than the previous case. If the first case doesnâ€™t have a value set, its value is 0.

//Recursive Enumerations -A recursive enumeration is an enumeration that has another instance of the enumeration as the associated value for one or more of the enumeration cases. You indicate that an enumeration case is recursive by writing indirect before it, which tells the compiler to insert the necessary layer of indirection.
